In order to optimally make use of solar energy through solar panels, we must consider the location and conditions they are built in both now, and in the future. Solar panels, in their current state, run optimially in locations that receive direct sunlight over long periods of time and are cold. Often, areas that recieve lots of direct sunlight are often areas that tend to be warmer so finding optimal conditions for solar panels is difficult. This project looks to detect these location using Nasa's Earth Observation datasets (https://neo.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The two in focus will be the dataset containing the amount of sunlight on areas of earth over the last 10 years (2012-2022) and the dataset containing the land temperature over the same period. 

By combining these datasets, we first identify the usability of a section of land for our needs over time, and then train a NN to predict the usability in the future. Two approachs: 1 using a vector representation of the whole image (map of all usability score) to vector of whole image for the next day RNN model to predict the the usability of locations on a map over time steps of days; 2 use a selection of features describing a unit of land and then see if predictions for its usability are predicable over 5 years.

The parameters we need to consider are the thresholds to define a metric of usability, range of acceptable error, and time frame of projection.
