    "From our example using temp of 18 degrees in ambient temperature and peak sunlight hours with no cloud cover (~1000W from online sources previously listed), we get 1.6504kWh/day if our unit operates only during peak hours for 4.5 hours. These parameters are used just to make sure we match the example data given often by online resources for solar panel installation in homes. Using https://www.solar.com/learn/how-much-energy-does-a-solar-panel-produce/ as our example, we can see that we are within reasonable values. solar.com gives 1.800kWh/day but assumes maximum efficiency. Our model accounts for cell temperature calculations and thus can tell we have a 8.3% efficiency decrease thus giving a lower PV output. If we set our ambient temperature $T_A$ to 0 degrees celcius, we can see cell temperature drops to ~25 degrees, the temperature the 400W output was measured by the manufacture and thus we perfectly match solar.coms results at 1.8kWh/day! We have validated our results and calculations.\n",

For our targets (y values in our regression) we calculate: Average kWh/day for the year, kWh/year, and kWh/month (sum every 30 days, ignore last 5 days)."
